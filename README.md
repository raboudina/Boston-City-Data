# Boston-City-Data

## Project description:
- This project is an exercise on using JSON, and array manipulation. 
- We used curl to get the Boston City data from https://pollysnips.s3.amazonaws.com/bostonEmployeeSalaries.json. 
- The project picks the top 5 earners in Boston (total salary + overtime) and list them out in the web page as shown below:
Name     
Total Earned 
- It displays a list of all employees who make more than 200K.


## How to run:
Click on the page and see the lists in plain text format.

## Roadmap:
- A good application would be to use the boston city data to calculate the average salary of all employees in each zipcode in the city. 
- We can also and have this average displayed with the map clustering feature of MAPBOX on the different zipcode boundaries of the city of Boston.
